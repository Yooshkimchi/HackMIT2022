This is an dedicated towards using machine-learning to determine the optimal times of the day to schedule non-essential tasks around your calendar. 

Typically, people tend to include essential events in their calendars, such as classes, scheduled events, etc. However, people, such as ourselves, often overlook the necessity to pre-plan and schedule non-essential tasks, such as groceries, or visiting the gym. Our app is designed to help people find the best times for these activities without having to lift a finger, promoting helpful habits and helping people further their development and growth.
